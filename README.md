## About B端k
> A markdown based documentation generator.

B端k is a fast and simple markdown based static site generator geared towards documentation.

Simply drop in your .md files in a folder, update manifest.json and you get a blazing fast wiki with an integrated fuzzy search feature.

## Quickstart

1) Get B端k
> ##### Github

> Version controlling your documents

* If you need to version control your documents, we recommend you to [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository and then sync it whenever a new release becomes available.
* Or you can also simply change the remote after creating an empty repo on your github account: 
```
git clone https://github.com/hang-up/buk.git buk
cd buk
npm install
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YOUR OWN USER NAME/buk.git
```

> ##### NPM
B端k is also available on NPM. However, it cannot be considered a 'dependency' per se. As such, you will need to extract it from `/node_modules` after installing from NPM.

```
npm install buuk

# move buuk out of node_modules
mv node_modules/buuk . && cd buuk  && npm install

# change remote if version control is needed
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YOUR OWN USER NAME/buk.git
```
---

2) Drop your markdown files in `docs`.
3) Update `manifest.json`
4) `npm run build`
5) The generated output will be in `/dist`. Serve from this folder if need be.
